## Submit

Any high school student may submit independently or through their school. You can submit one piece or a small number of pieces. You can submit at any time of the year. The closing date each year is 1 April (late-posted entries have until 1 May).

The easiest way to submit is to email your piece(s) in Times New Roman 12 pt to englishalive@iafrica.com. (Please don’t use other fonts or sizes, unless it is essential for the piece.)

Or you can post them to: English Alive Box 23912 Claremont 7735.

Remember to put your name and school after each piece, i.e. below it. (We don’t need to know your age or Grade.)

Publication is usually around mid-August each year.

We also invite students to submit artwork for consideration for the cover. Send this by email as a high-resolution 300 dpi jpg to [englishalive@iafrica.com](mailto:englishalive@iafrica.com).

English Alive is not a competition: there are no cups or cheques handed out for ‘the best’ pieces of writing. Publication is the acknowledgement of writing of quality.

A last cautionary note. Plagiarism is theft, theft of someone else’s words and ideas. No one would want to be guilty of that. Original thinking and original writing are so much more worthwhile!
